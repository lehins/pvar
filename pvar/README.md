# Overview

Main features include:

* Perfomance. There is practically no overhead when compared to operating on pure values,
  although there is a higher memory overhead, since `PVar` is backed by a
  `MutableByteArray#`
* Atomic operations for `PVar`s with `Int` values. This includes a unique function that is
  not availiable in `ghc-prim` out of the box:

```haskell
atomicModifyIntPVar :: PrimMonad m => PVar m Int -> (Int -> (Int, a)) -> m a
```

* Works in `PrimMonad`, therfore usable with `ST`, `IO` and various transformer monads.
* Easy access to `PVar` contents with `Storable`
* `isByteArrayPinned`, `isMutableByteArrayPinned` function that work on ghc-7.10 and
  ghc-8.0 as well as all the newer ones.
